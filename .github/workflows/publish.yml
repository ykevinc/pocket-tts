            ## Pocket TTS v0.2.5 (Publish Pipeline Final Fix)
            
            This release fixes a "dirty working directory" error during CI publish by adding the `--allow-dirty` flag for crates with generated assets.
            
            ### Key Changes
            - Added `--allow-dirty` to `cargo publish` in CI
            - Synchronized all crate versions to 0.2.5
            - Explicitly included `web/dist` in `pocket-tts-cli` package
            - Fixed `server_tests.rs` static asset routing failure
            - Fixed `StreamingMultiheadAttention` for voice cloning prefill
            - Restored numerical parity with reference Python implementation
            - Added web-based UI for live testing
